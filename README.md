EDA 1 - Human Body Temperatures

What is the true normal human body temperature?

Background
The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37°C or 98.6°F for more than 120 years after it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct?

EDA 2 - Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market

Background
Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers. In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not. Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer.

EDA - Hospital Readmissions Data Analysis and Recommendations for Reduction
Background
In October 2012, the US government's Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began reducing Medicare payments for Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals with excess readmissions. Excess readmissions are measured by a ratio, by dividing a hospital’s number of “predicted” 30-day readmissions for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia by the number that would be “expected,” based on an average hospital with similar patients. A ratio greater than 1 indicates excess readmissions.

Exercise Directions
In this exercise, you will 1. critique a preliminary analysis of readmissions data and recommendations (provided below) for reducing the readmissions rate. 2. construct a statistically sound analysis and make recommendations of your own.
