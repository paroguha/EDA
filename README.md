EDA 1 - Human Body Temperatures

What is the true normal human body temperature?

Background
The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37°C or 98.6°F for more than 120 years after it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct?

EDA 2 - Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market

Background
Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers. In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not. Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer.
